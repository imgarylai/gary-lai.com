# Intro

This is my [personal blog](https://gary-lai.com) built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). All the posts are written in markdown foramt and stored on GitHub repo.

## Features

- Write posts in `.mdx`.
- Create a post through command `creat-post`.
- Generate archive pages with pagination.
- Generate tag pages with pagination.
- Use [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) for the style.

## How to use

### Create a post

```shell
$ create-post
✔ What is the file name? Example
✔ What is the post title? Example Post
✔ What is the post description?
Post Example Post was created at /path/to/project/src/posts/example.mdx

description: ''
date: '2021-05-24T19:25:25+08:00'
